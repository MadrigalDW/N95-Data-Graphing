# N95-Data-Graphing
MatLab graphing of data sets on N95 mask decontamination.

Files in Original folder are the original files, the Modularized folder contains updated, modularized versions of the code.
The Modularized files are a work in progress, currently with files that replace N95_Graphs_Colour, N95_Graphs_BW, and N95_Graphs_Combined_I.
I will also be working on improving the comments of the files to make them more readable.
